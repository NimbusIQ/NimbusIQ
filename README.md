- 👋 Hi, I’m @NimbusIQ better known as Dustin Moore
- 👀 I’m interested in building ADK Full Stacks for niche industries I've got work experience in. And teaching those to build with AI rather than fear AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to rebuild my codes into Custom ADK Solutions scale and attempting to be AI First
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building 20 startups at once. Can it be done on scale? I think so! 
- 📫 How to reach me is to go to my LinkedIn, Facebook, Google Business Page or fly to Texas ;)  
- 😄 Pronouns: Yeah, procrastination 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am an excellent sim racing amateur with 2,500 hrs. Fly drones, ride mountain bikes, rollerbladed Manhattan for a summer, swam with sharks in Hawaii, dolphins in Florida, volunteered in Honduras, walked Italy, skied Colorado, swam and fished the Snake River in Jackson Hole, was an assistant to a billionaire during the first tech boom. I shoot guns, eat organics, and fear no death and am a genuine lover of life.
